Simple HTTP game server
=======
learning playground

React Front hosted on .Net Core MVC Backend

Once it starts working I want to use it to prototype
simple multipleyer browser games.

Host this locally on IIS.
With potential Cloud deployment, if any of games are actually fun.

- no auth
- no db, I'll use files for now
